# PHC Coding Club

We aim to organise Coding Clubs weekly, with alternating guided (_Guided Coding Club_, for details see schedule below) and open (_Open Coding Club_) sessions.
During the _guided_ sessions someone from the group introduces a new tool or topic and during the _open_ sessions we discuss the previous sessions or just code together on our own projects.
